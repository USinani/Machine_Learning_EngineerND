Plagiarism detector project 

To perform Feature engineering the following tasks were taken.
-Clean and pre-process the data.
-Define features for comparing the similarity of an answer text and a source text, and extract similarity features.
-Select "good" features, by analyzing the correlations between different features.
-Create train/test .csv files that hold the relevant features and class labels for train/test data points.

These features were then taken to train a classification mode.
